        In Egyptian mythology, Sekhmet was believed to unleash her wrath upon
        humanity as a punishment for their disobedience. Her ferocity was said
        to be so great that it took the intervention of the god Thoth to appease
        her and prevent total destruction. Despite her destructive aspects,
        Sekhmet was also associated with healing and was believed to possess the
        power to cure illnesses and ward off evil spirits.
