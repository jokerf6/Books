        Seshat, in ancient Egyptian religion, the goddess of writing and measurement and the ruler of books. She was the consort of the god Djhuty (Thoth), and both were divine scribes (sesb). She was portrayed as a female wearing a headband with horns and a star with her name written on it. Representations of her typically show her dress to be a plain sheath covered by a long panther skin, with the tail reaching her feet. She was often depicted with the notched palm rib that represented the passing of time.
